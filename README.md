Space Audio / Video Merger


# Introduction
Who doesn't love listening to music while working? And everyone loves watching space videos! So Space Jordan works on combining those two things: adding a soundtrack from latest sci-fi lofi music to space live video stream. Who would dare procrastinate (not us!) by making them listen with one hand as they work with the other?

The video and audio combined create a very sci-fi feeling that makes you feel empowered to complete your tasks. This project also contains informative information about space to educate people more about it.

We don't want children to grow up dreaming of becoming astronauts, we want them to understand space by watching videos.

# What It Does

It takes the latest sci-fi lofi beats and adds it as a soundtrack to space videos, making them more enjoyable for users and helping them stay productive.

We provide a wealth of information about space in our website, making it easier for people to learn more about the vast beauty surrounding us. It also helps children understand topics such as space much more easily.
